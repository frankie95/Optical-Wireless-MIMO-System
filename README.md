# FYP
This FYP project is to develop a wireless optical communication system for transmitting data between computer and mobile phone by using the intensity of the light.  
There are two short demo(demo1 & demo2).  
I am just providing another method to transmit data safely, but at this moment the transfer rate is low and has to improve the accuracy.(but it depends on mobile camera quality.)
